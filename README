=== Installation ===
1. Place this application into a directory where cgi-scripts are evaluated.
   Make sure, that the webserver can execute ruby + bzr.
2. Copy config_sample.rb to config.rb to start with a default configuration.
3. The webserver needs the permission to write into the directory 
4. You have to build a .mo file from the .po file in order to use the 
   localization. Type:
      make locale/de/dudle.mo
   If this does not work for you, you can download the .mo file from another
   server, i.e., http://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/locale/de/dudle.mo and put it
   into the directory locale/de.
